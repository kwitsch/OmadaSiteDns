# OmadaSiteDns

DNS server for hostname and reverse DNS lookups in a omada site.

## Hostnames

Hostnames are generated by converting the omada client names to valid hostnames.

### Criteria

* less than 254 characters in length
* are lowercase
* contain only a-z, 0-9, - and .
* don't start or end with - or .

### Conversion

1. client name is converted to lowercase
2. loop through converters and replace every regex match with its substitute
3. delete remaining illegal charactersdelete remaining il

## Exposed ports

The server for those protocolls are enabled with the OSD_SERVER_UDP and OSD_SERVER_TCP variable.

The service won't start if both servers are disabled.
